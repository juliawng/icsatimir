      IV<br>
      <br>
      His soul stretched tight across the skies<br>
      That fade behind a city block,<br>
      Or trampled by insistent feet<br>
      At four and five and six o’clock;<br>
      And short square fingers stuffing pipes,<br>
      And evening newspapers, and eyes<br>
      Assured of certain certainties,<br>
      The conscience of a blackened street<br>
      Impatient to assume the world.<br>
      <br>
      I am moved by fancies that are curled<br>
      Around these images, and cling:<br>
      The notion of some infinitely gentle<br>
      Infinitely suffering thing.<br>
      <br>
      Wipe your hand across your mouth, and laugh;<br>
      The worlds revolve like ancient women<br>
      Gathering fuel in vacant lots.<br>

      <h5><br><br>marianne moore</h5>
      <p>
      An Octopus<br>
      <br>
      of ice. Deceptively reserved and flat,<br>
      it lies “in grandeur and in mass”<br>
      beneath a sea of shifting snow-dunes;<br>
      dots of cyclamen-red and maroon on its clearly defined pseudo-podia<br>
      made of glass that will bend—a much needed invention—<br>
      comprising twenty-eight ice-fields from fifty to five hundred feet thick,<br>
      of unimagined delicacy.<br>
      “Picking periwinkles from the cracks”<br>
      or killing prey with the concentric crushing rigor of the python,<br>
      it hovers forward “spider fashion<br>
      on its arms” misleadingly like lace;<br>
      its “ghostly pallor changing<br>
      to the green metallic tinge of an anemone-starred pool.”<br>
      The fir-trees, in “the magnitude of their root systems,”<br>
      rise aloof from these maneuvers “creepy to behold,”<br>
      austere specimens of our American royal families,<br>
      “each like the shadow of the one beside it.<br>
      The rock seems frail compared with their dark energy of life,”<br>
      its vermilion and onyx and manganese-blue interior expansiveness<br>
      left at the mercy of the weather;<br>
      “stained transversely by iron where the water drips down,”<br>
      recognized by its plants and its animals.<br>
      Completing a circle,<br>
      you have been deceived into thinking that you have progressed,<br>
      under the polite needles of the larches<br>
      “hung to filter, not to intercept the sunlight”—<br>
      met by tightly wattled spruce-twigs<br>
      “conformed to an edge like clipped cypress<br>
      as if no branch could penetrate the cold beyond its company”;<br>
      and dumps of gold and silver ore enclosing The Goat’s Mirror—<br>
      that lady-fingerlike depression in the shape of the left human foot,<br>
      which prejudices you in favor of itself<br>
      before you have had time to see the others;<br>
      its indigo, pea-green, blue-green, and turquoise,<br>
      from a hundred to two hundred feet deep,<br>
      “merging in irregular patches in the middle lake<br>
      where, like gusts of a storm<br>
      obliterating the shadows of the fir-trees, the wind makes lanes of ripples.”<br>
      What spot could have merits of equal importance<br>
      for bears, elk, deer, wolves, goats, and ducks?<br>
      Pre-empted by their ancestors,<br>
      this is the property of the exacting porcupine, <br>
      and of the rat “slipping along to its burrow in the swamp<br>
      or pausing on high ground to smell the heather”;<br>
      of “thoughtful beavers<br>
      making drains which seem the work of careful men with shovels,”<br>
      and of the bears inspecting unexpectedly<br>
      ant-hills and berry-bushes.<br>
      Composed of calcium gems and alabaster pillars,<br>
      topaz, tourmaline crystals and amethyst quartz,<br>
      their den is somewhere else, concealed in the confusion<br>
      of “blue forests thrown together with marble and jasper and agate<br>
      as if whole quarries had been dynamited.”<br>
      And farther up, in stag-at-bay position<br>
      as a scintillating fragment of these terrible stalagmites,<br>
      stands the goat,<br>
      its eye fixed on the waterfall which never seems to fall—<br>
      an endless skein swayed by the wind,<br>
      immune to force of gravity in the perspective of the peaks.<br>
      A special antelope<br>
      acclimated to “grottoes from which issue penetrating draughts<br>
      which make you wonder why you came,”<br>
      it stands its ground<br>
      on cliffs the color of the clouds, of petrified white vapor—<br>
      black feet, eyes, nose, and horns, engraved on dazzling ice-fields, <br>
      the ermine body on the crystal peak;<br>
      the sun kindling its shoulders to maximum heat like acetylene, dyeing them white—<br>
      upon this antique pedestal,<br>
      “a mountain with those graceful lines which prove it a volcano,”<br>
      its top a complete cone like Fujiyama’s<br>
      till an explosion blew it off.<br>
      Distinguished by beauty<br>
      of which “the visitor dare never fully speak at home<br>
      for fear of being stoned as an impostor,”<br>
      Big Snow Mountain is the home of a diversity of creatures:<br>
      those who “have lived in hotels<br>
      but who now live in camps—who prefer to”;<br>
      the mountain guide evolving from the trapper,<br>
      “in two pairs of trousers, the outer one older,<br>
      wearing slowly away from the feet to the knees”;<br>
      “the nine-striped chipmunk<br>
      running with unmammal-like agility along a log”;<br>
      the water ouzel<br>
      with “its passion for rapids and high-pressured falls,”<br>
      building under the arch of some tiny Niagara;<br>
      the white-tailed ptarmigan “in winter solid white, <br>
      feeding on heather-bells and alpine buckwheat”;<br>
      and the eleven eagles of the west,<br>
      “fond of the spring fragrance and the winter colors,”<br>
      used to the unegoistic action of the glaciers<br>
      and “several hours of frost every midsummer night.”<br>
      “They make a nice appearance, don’t they,”<br>
      happy seeing nothing?<br>
      Perched on treacherous lava and pumice—<br>
      those unadjusted chimney-pots and cleavers<br>
      which stipulate “names and addresses of persons to notify<br>
      in case of disaster”—<br>
      they hear the roar of ice and supervise the water<br>
      winding slowly through the cliffs,<br>
      the road “climbing like the thread<br>
      which forms the groove around a snail-shell,<br>
      doubling back and forth until where snow begins, it ends.”<br>
      No “deliberate wide-eyed wistfulness” is here<br>
      among the boulders sunk in ripples and white water<br>
      where “when you hear the best wild music of the forest<br> 
      it is sure to be a marmot,”<br>
      the victim on some slight observatory,<br>
      of “a struggle between curiosity and caution,”<br>
      inquiring what has scared it:<br>
      a stone from the moraine descending in leaps,<br>
      another marmot, or the spotted ponies with glass eyes,<br>
      brought up on frosty grass and flowers<br>
      and rapid draughts of ice-water.<br>
      Instructed, none knows how, to climb the mountain,<br>
      by businessmen who require for recreation<br>
      three hundred and sixty-five holidays in the year,<br>
      these conspicuously spotted little horses are peculiar;<br>
      hard to discern among the birch-trees, ferns, and lily-pads,<br>
      avalanche lilies, Indian paint-brushes,<br>
      bears’ ears and kittentails,<br>
      and miniature cavalcades of chlorophylless fungi<br>
      magnified in profile on the moss-beds like moonstones in the water;<br>
      the cavalcade of calico competing<br>
      with the original American menagerie of styles<br>
      among the white flowers of the rhododendron surmounting rigid leaves<br>
      upon which moisture works its alchemy,<br>
      transmuting verdure into onyx.<br>
      <br>
      “Like happy souls in Hell,” enjoying mental difficulties, the Greeks<br>
      amused themselves with delicate behavior<br>
      because it was “so noble and so fair”; <br>
      not practiced in adapting their intelligence<br>
      to eagle-traps and snow-shoes,<br>
      to alpenstocks and other toys contrived by those<br>
      “alive to the advantage of invigorating pleasure.”<br>
      Bows, arrows, oars, and paddles, for which trees provide the wood,<br>
      in new countries more eloquent than elsewhere—<br>
      augmenting the assertion that, essentially human,<br>
      “the forest affords wood for dwellings and by its beauty<br>
      stimulates the moral vigor of its citizens.”<br>
      The Greeks liked smoothness, distrusting what was back<br>
      of what could not be clearly seen,<br>
      resolving with benevolent conclusiveness,<br>
      “Complexities which still will be complexities<br>
      as long as the world lasts”;<br>
      ascribing what we clumsily call happiness,<br>
      to “an accident or a quality,<br>
      a spiritual substance or the soul itself,<br>
      an act, a disposition, or a habit,<br>
      or a habit infused, to which the soul has been persuaded,<br>
      or something distinct from a habit, a power”—<br>
      such power as Adam had and we are still devoid of.<br>
      “Emotionally sensitive, their hearts were hard”;<br>
      their wisdom was remote<br>
      from that of these odd oracles of cool official sarcasm,<br>
      upon this game preserve<br>
      where “guns, nets, seines, traps and explosives,<br>
      hired vehicles, gambling and intoxicants are prohibited;<br>
      disobedient persons being summarily removed<br>
      and not allowed to return without permission in writing.”<br>
      It is self-evident<br>
      that it is frightful to have everything afraid of one;<br>
      that one must do as one is told<br>
      and eat rice, prunes, dates, raisins, hardtack, and tomatoes<br>
      if one would “conquer the main peak of mount Tacoma,”<br>
      this fossil flower concise without a shiver,<br>
      intact when it is cut,<br>
      damned for its sacrosanct remoteness—<br>
      like Henry James “damned by the public for decorum”;<br>
      not decorum, but restraint;<br>
      it is the love of doing hard things<br>
      that rebuffed and wore them out—a public out of sympathy with neatness.<br>
      Neatness of finish! Neatness of finish!<br>
      Relentless accuracy is the nature of this octopus<br>
      with its capacity for fact.<br>
      “Creeping slowly as with meditated stealth,<br>
      its arms seeming to approach from all directions,”<br>
      it receives one under winds that “tear the snow to bits<br>
      and hurl it like a sandblast<br>
      shearing off twigs and loose bark from the trees.”<br>
      Is “tree” the word for these things<br>
      “flat on the ground like vines”?<br>
      some “bent in a half-circle with branches on one side<br>
      suggesting dust-brushes, not trees;<br>
      some finding strength in union, forming little stunted groves,<br>
      their flattened mats of branches shrunk in trying to escape”<br>
      from the hard mountain “planed by ice and polished by the wind”—<br>
      the white volcano with no weather side;<br>
      the lightning flashing at its base,<br>
      rain falling in the valleys, and snow falling on the peak—<br>
      this glassy octopus symmetrically pointed,<br>
      its claw cut by the avalanche<br>
      “with a sound like the crack of a rifle,<br>
      in a curtain of powdered snow launched like a waterfall.”
